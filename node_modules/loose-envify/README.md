loose-envify
Build Status

Fast (and loose) selective process.env replacer using js-tokens instead of an AST. Works just like envify but much faster.

Gotchas
Doesn't handle broken syntax.
Doesn't look inside embedded expressions in template strings.
this won't work:
console.log(`the current env is ${process.env.NODE_ENV}`);
Doesn't replace oddly-spaced or oddly-commented expressions.
this won't work:
console.log(process./*won't*/env./*work*/NODE_ENV);
Usage/Options
loose-envify has the exact same interface as envify, including the CLI.
